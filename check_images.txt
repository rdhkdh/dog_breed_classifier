Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all 3 models classified the breed of Dog_01.jpg to be same, i.e. golden retriever.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all 3 models classified both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg to be of the same breed.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, all 3 models correctly classified Frog_01.jpg and Car_01.jpg to be 'non-dogs'.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: All three model architectures give correct answers in the 3 cases above. But their execution times vary as follows: VGG = 8s, AlexNet = 1s, ResNet= 4s. AlexNet gives output in the shortest time. Therefore, AlexNet architecture is best as it combines speed and accuracy.
